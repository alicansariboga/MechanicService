- City-specific branch operations
- Reset Password via Mail
- Two-factor auth is not declared.
- Many of the data on the pages of the website come dynamically from the database.

### Notes
- 1) Since the project has many frontend design files and languages, I hide them in the ".gitattributes" file. So, this project contains many HTML, CSS, scss, and JS code.
- 2) I did not add the database used in the project here, but you can create the database on Microsoft SQL Server by migrating with EF Core.
- 3) There is no user panel for customers in the Car Service web application system. The reason for this is that similar websites I have examined do not have this process. For this reason, I did not add a panel for customers to the project, but additions can be made by taking the admin panel as an example.
