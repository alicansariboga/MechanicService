## MY NOTES

	- The entities have been created, but I am not sure about the reservation part distinction I made. Therefore, the reservation entity list can be updated later. A more accurate path is chosen during API tests and linq queries.
	- 3 campaign header information has been added to the campaign entity. Instead, a more dynamic title system can be added. This section will also be revised in the future.

## REVISIONS

	- The name of the district property in the reservation service entity is spelled incorrectly. It will be corrected.

	- Entity connection will be made to reservation services for service information.

	- User confirmation attribute will be added for reservation entity.

	- Entity and API operations were not performed for Contact. These will also be added.

	- Reservation inquiry screen for users.
